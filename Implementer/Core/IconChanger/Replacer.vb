        ' Basically, you can change icons with the UpdateResource api call.
        ' When you make the call you say "I'm updating an icon", and you send the icon data.
        ' The main problem is that ICO files store the icons in one set of structures, and exe/dll files store them in
        ' another set of structures. So you have to translate between the two -- you can't just load the ICO file as
        ' bytes and send them with the UpdateResource api call.
